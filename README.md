### What is this? ###

* Well, this is a simple Sudoku solver that I created from scratch.

### How does this work? ###

* You just have to enter the numbers and hit `Solve Grid`.

### Why use that? ###

* Because it's a web-based app
    * It can be added to your phone's home page
    * It doesn't need an internet connection once installed
